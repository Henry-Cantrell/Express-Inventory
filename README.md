# Express-Inventory-App

Deployed live here: https://desolate-brook-79264.herokuapp.com/

This is a simple CRUD app built using Node/Express and a MongoDB backend. Mongoose is the ODM and the project was styled using Sass/Bootstrap. Jade was used as the template engine.

The application concept is an Ebay-esque ecommerce store offering motorcycles and motorcycle riding gear. Users are able to perform CRUD operations on listings, as well as "purchase" items (no actual transactions are made and users do not have to enter real financial info).

There is also a messaging system where users can communicate about purchase details, as well as a profile section where users can list contact info and location.
